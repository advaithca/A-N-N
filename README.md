# A N N
 ANN in python without using any Neural Network Libraries

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of an Artificial Neural Network in python without using any Neural Network Libraries. The code is written in a way that it is easy to understand and can be used as a reference for understanding the working of a neural network.

## Motivation
I've been learning about Neural Networks again in Image Processing, thought I would do something I've always wanted to do, to explore the mathemathics behind the Neural Networks and implement it from scratch. Well, not scratch, I have used NumPy for matrix operations.

## What I've done so far
I've implemented a simple Neural Network to perform classification on the Iris dataset (Fishers Iris dataset). The dataset has 4 features and 3 classes. I've used a 3 layer Neural Network with 4 input nodes, 2 hidden layers with 8 nodes each and 3 output nodes. The activation function used is the sigmoid function. The Neural Network is trained using the backpropagation algorithm.
